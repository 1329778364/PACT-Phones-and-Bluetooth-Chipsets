# PACT Phones and Bluetooth Chipsets

A PACT Dataset

PACT Phones and Bluetooth Chipsets v3 06may20

This spreadsheet catalogs a wide range of commonly available phones and their Bluetooth chipsets based on openly available information
as part of the PACT project.  Please feel free to edit/add/enrich this data.

Note that "chipset" in this case refers to the physical chip as manufactured into the handset.  In many cases this is different than the
*design* - for instance, the Murata KM9D19075 in the Samsung S20 is an OEM product based on a Cypress or Broadcom design - and these
vendors may sell the same layout/die in their own packaging with their own part number.  In many cases, the specific handset part is
a unique number for the handset vendor.
